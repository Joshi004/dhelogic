    "projectSummary": "We built an enterprise contract digitization platform that solves a critical problem: companies with 10-20+ years of history accumulate millions of contracts that become inaccessible sources of truth. This creates significant revenue leakage—companies lose money on renewals, pricing, and compliance because salespeople can't interpret legal contracts and legal teams can't read millions of documents. Our platform ingests contracts at scale, uses ML-powered extraction with RAG systems and specialized models (LegolBERT, YOLO), and provides a searchable repository that puts contract intelligence at anyone's fingertips. Through a two-phase transformation—first optimizing architecture and UX (30-40% improvement), then implementing ML pipelines (80-90% improvement)—we enabled exponential rather than linear business scaling.",

        "title": "Scale and Volume",
        "description": "Enterprise companies accumulate millions of contracts spanning 100-200 pages each. No human team can process this volume—it would require prohibitively large legal teams. The sheer magnitude makes contracts effectively inaccessible despite being the source of truth for customer relationships, pricing, and obligations.",

        "title": "Legacy System Bottlenecks",
        "description": "The original monolithic architecture couldn't scale. The UI forced context switching—legal teams had to open PDFs in separate tabs while filling forms. Loading 100-200 page PDFs took too long, creating frustrating delays. These architectural and UX issues severely limited digitization throughput.",

        "description": "Salespeople need contract data for renewals and pricing but aren't trained to interpret complex legal language. Legal teams become bottlenecks for every contract query.

        "title": "Microservices Decomposition",
        "description": "Transformed the monolithic architecture into independent services: Upload Service (contract ingestion), Preprocessing Service (OCR + image generation), Digitization Service (core extraction logic), and Rendering Service (UI display). Used event-driven communication via Kafka for asynchronous processing. This enabled independent scaling—we could add more digitization workers without affecting upload or rendering performance."

      {
        "title": "Smart PDF Processing Pipeline",
        "description": "Created dual-format processing: generated OCR text for extraction and converted PDFs to individual page images for UI rendering. This solved the load time problem—we lazy-load the first 5 pages immediately, then load additional pages on scroll. Since most critical data appears in the first few pages, users experienced fast load times even with 200-page contracts."
      },
      {
        "title": "UX-Driven Digitization",
        "description": "Redesigned the interface with a 20-80 split layout: PDF viewer on the left, form on the right. Eliminated context switching entirely. Implemented citation-based auto-extraction—legal teams mark regions on the PDF, and using coordinate mapping + OCR data, the system automatically extracts and populates form fields. This reduced manual typing and improved accuracy."

      {
        "title": "RAG-Based Key Term Extraction",
        "description": "Built ML pipelines using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to work around context limits. Vectorized all PDFs and stored embeddings in Qdrant (dynamic data) and Milvus (static indexes). For each key term (buyer entity, effective date, seller entity, etc.), we retrieve only relevant sections semantically, then pass them to specialized models like LegolBERT. Created a graphical network showing which extractions run in parallel vs. sequence."

      {
        "title": "Continuous Learning Loop",
        "description": "Built a validation portal where legal teams review ML-extracted data. Incorrect extractions flow into a retraining pool, continuously improving model accuracy. Used models like LegolBERT for legal entity extraction and YOLO for signature detection (partial/full/unsigned). This human-in-the-loop approach ensured models learned domain-specific patterns and improved over time."

This delivered 30-40% faster digitization speed and cost reduction. Phase 2 added ML pipelines with RAG systems, achieving 80-90% total improvement—enabling exponential rather than linear business scaling."

Module bundles deployed to CloudFront independently, allowing rapid feature delivery without coordination overhead."

When contracts upload, events trigger preprocessing, which triggers digitization, which triggers ML extraction pipelines. Each service scales independently based on queue depth. This architecture handled millions of contracts without bottlenecks."
