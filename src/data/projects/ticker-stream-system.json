    "projectSummary": "We built a ticker stream generation system that creates synthetic market ticks by aggregating data from three real stock market indexes. Unlike traditional synthetic indexes that rely purely on algorithms, this system injects genuine market randomness while maintaining control and predictability. The result: a 24/7 ticker stream with natural volatility, perfect for algorithm testing and synthetic trading environments.",

        "title": "Sub-50ms Latency Requirements",
        "description": "Real-time ticker generation demands extremely low latency (~50ms end-to-end). With data arriving from three different stock market indexes (~50ms), the core processing had to complete within a 20-30ms window. Coordinating between Node.js services and a C++ performance engine added complexity to an already tight time constraint.",

The system needed to handle missing or delayed data from individual sources without blocking the entire pipeline, while ensuring consistent 1 tick/second delivery regardless of source irregularities.",

      {
        "title": "Real Randomness vs Algorithmic Control",
        "description": "Traditional synthetic indexes are purely algorithmic—predictable and lacking real market volatility. We needed to inject natural market randomness from real indexes while balancing stability through multi-index averaging. The algorithmic processing had to enhance, not override, genuine market behavior.",

        "description": "The system subscribes to three real stock market indexes simultaneously, receiving tick updates approximately every 50ms. By aggregating and averaging real market data, we inject natural volatility while providing resilience against single-source failures. Geographic distribution ensures at least three indexes are always active, with the system dynamically switching based on market hours."

        "description": "Built on Kafka streams for multi-source market data ingestion. Node.js consumers process events from multiple market indexes with varying update frequencies, coordinate the data aggregation, and delegate core processing to the C++ engine. This architecture enables independent scaling and natural retry mechanisms for failed operations."

        "title": "Volume-Independent Pricing",
        "description": "Synthetic tick generation is completely decoupled from trade volume. Prices are derived solely from source market indexes plus algorithmic processing, ensuring trading activity has zero impact on ticker values. This provides a manipulation-resistant environment ideal for algorithm testing and validation."

        "title": "Algorithmic Normalization & Outlier Handling",
        "description": "All index data undergoes algorithmic normalization before processing, with configurable volatility limits to filter extreme outliers or Flash Crash scenarios. This ensures the system maintains natural market behavior within acceptable bounds while preventing anomalous data from corrupting the synthetic tick stream."
