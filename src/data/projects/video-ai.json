        "title": "Context Length Limits",

        "title": "Multi-Stream Processing",

      {
        "title": "Vector Indexing Strategy",
        "description": "We evaluated multiple approaches for creating searchable indexes. The solution uses rich vector embeddings generated from each stream, then merged into a unified index. This allows semantic search—finding content by meaning, not just keywords."

        "title": "Smart Clustering",

        "title": "Algorithmic Efficiency",
        "description": "To work around model context limits, we developed mechanical approaches that reduce the load on AI models. We use less token-intensive streams (like transcription) to guide the heavier analysis, and semantic clustering of vectors to identify what actually needs detailed processing."
